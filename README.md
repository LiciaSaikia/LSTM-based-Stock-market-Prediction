# LSTM-based-Stock-market-Prediction

**A user-friendly AI app to forecast future stock prices using deep learning.**

Welcome to a stock market forecasting tool built using Python, Streamlit, and LSTM neural networks. This app lets you input a stock symbol (like `AAPL`, `TSLA`, etc.) and see predicted future prices based on past market trends. It's built with accessibility in mind—no coding required to use.

## Why Forecast Stock Prices?

Predicting stock prices isn’t about perfect accuracy—it's about capturing **market trends**. With LSTM, we can analyze historical sequences and generate informed, multi-day forecasts. This helps investors and analysts make more confident decisions.
